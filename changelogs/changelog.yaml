  0.1.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Initial release as antsibull-changelog. The Ansible Changelog
        Tool has originally been developed by @mattclay in `the ansible/ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/packaging/release/changelogs/changelog.py>`_
        repository for Ansible itself. It has been extended in `felixfontein/ansible-changelog
        <https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-changelog/>`_ and `ansible-community/antsibull
        <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/>`_ to work with collections,
        until it was moved to its current location `ansible-community/antsibull-changelog
        <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/>`_.
    release_date: '2020-05-30'
  0.2.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Added more testing.
        - Fix internal API for ACD changelog generation (pruning and concatenation
          of changelogs).
        - Improve error handling.
        - Improve reStructuredText creation when new modules with and without namespace
          exist at the same time.
        - Title generation improved (remove superfluous space).
        - Use PyYAML C loader/dumper if available.
        - '``lint`` subcommand no longer requires specification whether it is run
          inside a collection or not (if usual indicators are absent).'
    release_date: '2020-05-31'
  0.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Allow to enumerate plugins/modules with ansible-doc by specifying ``--use-ansible-doc``.
    release_date: '2020-06-10'
  0.3.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to pass path to ansible-doc binary via ``--ansible-doc-bin``.
        - Changelog generator can be ran via ``python -m antsibull_changelog``.
        - Use ``ansible-doc`` instead of ``/path/to/checkout/bin/ansible-doc`` when
          being run in ansible-base checkouts.
    release_date: '2020-06-10'
  0.3.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Do not fail when ``changelogs/fragments`` does not exist. Simply assume
          there are no fragments in that case.
        - Improve behavior when ``changelogs/config.yaml`` is not a dictionary, or
          does not contain ``sections``.
        - Improve error message when ``--is-collection`` is specified and ``changelogs/config.yaml``
          cannot be found, or when the ``lint`` subcommand is used.
    release_date: '2020-06-11'
  0.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix bad module namespace detection when collection was symlinked into Ansible's
          collection search path. This also allows to add releases to collections
          which are not installed in a way that Ansible finds them.
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to enable or disable flatmapping via ``config.yaml``.
    release_date: '2020-06-22'
  0.5.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - The internal changelog generator code got more flexible to help antsibull
          generate Ansible porting guides.
    release_date: '2020-06-28'
  0.6.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - New changelog configurations place the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` file by default
          in the top-level directory, and not in ``changelogs/``.
        - The config option ``archive_path_template`` allows to move fragments into
          an archive directory when ``keep_fragments`` is set to ``false``.
        - The option ``use_fqcn`` (set to ``true`` in new configurations) allows to
          use FQCN for new plugins and modules.
    release_date: '2020-07-12'
  0.7.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - A new config option, ``ignore_other_fragment_extensions`` allows for configuring
          whether only ``.yaml`` and ``.yml`` files are used (as mandated by the ``ansible-test
          sanity --test changelog`` test). The default value for existing configurations
          is ``false``, and for new configurations ``true``.
        - Allow to use semantic versioning also for Ansible-base with the ``use_semantic_versioning``
          configuration setting.
        - Refactoring changelog generation code to provide all preludes (release summaries)
          in changelog entries, and provide generic functionality to extract a grouped
          list of versions. These changes are mainly for the antsibull project.
    release_date: '2020-07-26'
  0.8.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to not save a changelog on release when using API.
        - Allow to sanitize changelog data on load/save. This means that unknown information
          will be removed, and bad information will be stripped. This will be enabled
          in newly created changelog configs, but is disabled for backwards compatibility.
    release_date: '2020-08-18'
  0.8.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fixed error on generating changelogs when using the trivial section.
    release_date: '2020-08-27'
  0.9.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The new option ``prevent_known_fragments`` with default value being the
          value of ``keep_fragments`` allows to control whether fragments with names
          that already appeared in the past are ignored or not. The new behavior happens
          if ``keep_fragments=false``, and is less surprising to users (see https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/46).
          Changelogs with ``keep_fragments=true``, like the ansible-base/ansible-core
          changelog, are not affected.
      major_changes:
        - Add support for reporting new playbooks and roles in collections.
        - "Add support for special changelog fragment sections which add new plugins\
          \ and/or objects to the changelog for this version. This is mainly useful\
          \ for ``test`` and ``filter`` plugins, and for ``playbook`` and ``role``\
          \ objects, which are not yet automatically detected and mentioned in ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``\
          \ or the generated RST changelog.\n\nThe format of these sections and their\
          \ content is as follows::\n\n    ---\n    add plugin.filter:\n      - name:\
          \ to_time_unit\n        description: Converts a time expression to a given\
          \ unit\n      - name: to_seconds\n        description: Converts a time expression\
          \ to seconds\n    add object.role:\n      - name: nginx\n        description:\
          \ The most awesome nginx installation role ever\n    add object.playbook:\n\
          \      - name: wipe_server\n        description: Totally wipes a server\n\
          \nFor every entry, a list of plugins (section ``add plugin.xxx``) or objects\
          \ (section ``add object.xxx``) of the given type (``filter``, ``test`` for\
          \ plugins, ``playbook``, ``role`` for objects) will be added. Every plugin\
          \ or object has a short name as well as a short description. These fields\
          \ correspond to the module/plugin name and the ``short_description`` field\
          \ of the ``DOCUMENTATION`` block of modules and documentable plugins.\n"
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``--update-existing`` option for ``antsibull-changelog release``, which
          allows to update the current release's release date and (if relevant) codename
          instead of simply reporting that the release already exists.
    release_date: '2021-01-30'
  0.10.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure that the plugin caching inside ansible-base/-core works without
          ``--use-ansible-doc``.
      minor_changes:
        - The new ``--cummulative-release`` option for ``antsibull-changelog release``
          allows to add all plugins and objects to a release since whose ``version_added``
          is later than the previous release version (or ancestor if there was no
          previous release), and at latest the current release version. This is needed
          for major releases of ``community.general`` and similarly organized collections.
        - 'Will now print a warning when a release is made where the no ``prelude_section_name``
          section (default: ``release_summary``) appears.'
    release_date: '2021-04-26'
  0.11.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - When subdirectories of ``modules`` are used in ansible-base/ansible-core,
          the wrong module name was passed to ``ansible-doc`` when ``--use-ansible-doc``
          was not used.
      minor_changes:
        - When using ansible-core 2.11 or newer, will now detect new roles with argument
          spec. We only consider the ``main`` entrypoint of roles.
    release_date: '2021-06-13'
  0.12.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix prerelease collapsing when ``use_semantic_versioning`` is set to ``true``
          for ansible-core.
      minor_changes:
        - Support changelogs for other projects than ansible-core/-base and Ansible
          collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/60).

          temp directory (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/68,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/69).
        - Stop mentioning ``galaxy.yaml`` instead of ``galaxy.yml`` in some error
          messages (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/66).
      minor_changes:
        - Always lint fragments before releasing (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/65,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/67).

    release_date: '2021-12-13'
  0.14.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - The internal ``changelog.yaml`` linting API allows to use ``packaging.version.Version``
          for version numbers instead of semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/73).
        - Use the new ``--metadata-dump`` option for ansible-core 2.13+ to quickly
          dump and extract all module/plugin ``version_added`` values for the collection
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/72).

    changes:
      bugfixes:

      major_changes:

          install antsibull`` works exactly the same as before, but some users may
          be affected depending on how they build/install the project (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/109).

      bugfixes:
        - When multiple output formats are defined and ``antsibull-changelog generate``

  0.29.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Remove Python version check that was checking for Python >= 3.6 (instead
          of >= 3.9). This check is not really necessary since ``pyproject.toml``
          declares ``requires-python``, and old enough Python versions where pip does
          not know about ``requires-python`` will not load antsibull-changelog due
          to syntax errors anyway (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/167).
      minor_changes:
        - Add a ``reformat`` command that reformats ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``
          to the current settings of ``changelogs/config.yaml`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/169).
        - 'Adds a new configuration option ``changelog_sort``. This option allows
          sorting of changelog entries in ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/165).

          '
        - Replaces numbers with constants for return codes (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/77).
      release_summary: Feature release.
      removed_features:
        - Removes support for the deprecated classic changelog format. ``changes_format``
          must now be present and set to ``combined`` for ansible-core usage, and
          the value ``classic`` is no longer allowed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/137).

  0.30.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to configure the used VCS in ``changelogs/config.yml``. Valid choices
          are ``none`` (default), ``git``, or ``auto``. If set to ``git``, or ``auto``
          detects that the project is part of a Git repository, only non-ignored files
          will be copied to a temporary directory when trying to load information
          on Ansible modules, plugins and roles (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/172,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/175).
        - Antsibull-changelog now depends on the new package antsibull-docutils. This
          should not have any visible impact, expect potentially improved MarkDown
          output (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/174).
        - Antsibull-changelog now depends on the new project antsibull-fileutils (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/176).
        - If you are using `argcomplete <https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/>`__
          global completion, you can now tab-complete ``antsibull-changelog`` command
          lines. See `Activating global completion <https://pypi.org/project/argcomplete/#activating-global-completion>`__
          in the argcomplete README for how to enable tab completion globally. This
          will also tab-complete Ansible commands such as ``ansible-playbook`` and
          ``ansible-test`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/173).

  0.31.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - More internal code related to the old changelog format has been removed.
          This only potentially affects other projects which consume antsibull-changelog
          as a library. The sister antsibull projects antsibull-build and antsibull-docs
          might only be affected in older versions. **Users of the antsibull-changelog
          CLI tool are not affected by this change** (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/179).
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``--strict`` parameter to the ``lint-changelog-yaml`` subcommand to
          also check for extra fields that should not be there (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/182).
        - Declare support for Python 3.13 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/180).
        - 'Python API: allow to extract extra data when loading changelog files, and
          allow to insert extra data when saving (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/181).'
        - 'Python API: allow to preprocess changelog.yaml before linting (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/181).'

  0.32.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - When using antsibull-changelog as a library, ``ChangelogConfig``'s constructor
          should no longer be called directly. Instead, use the class method ``ChangelogConfig.parse()``,
          which has the same signature than the previous constructor, except that
          ``ignore_is_other_project`` now must be a keyword parameter (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/193).
        - 'When using antsibull-changelog as a library, ``rendering.changelog.generate_changelog()``
          now needs a ``ChangelogOutput`` object instead of the ``document_format:
          TextFormat`` parameter, and the ``config`` and ``changelog_path`` parameters
          have been removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/194).'
        - When using the ``--output`` argument for ``antsibull-changelog generate``,
          the generated changelog's title will not contain any parts of the version
          number. If you need this, `please create an issue <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/new>`__
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/194).
      deprecated_features:
        - The configuration settings ``changelog_filename_template``, ``changelog_filename_version_depth``,
          and ``output_formats`` are deprecated and will eventually be removed. Use
          the new setting ``output`` instead. Note that there are no runtime warnings
          right now. If the time to remove them comes nearer, there will be runtime
          warnings for a longer time first before they are actually removed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/194).
      major_changes:
        - The new configuration setting ``output`` allows to configure more precisely
          which changelog files are generated and how they are formatted (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/190,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/194).
      minor_changes:
        - Antsibull-changelog now depends on Pydantic 2 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/193).
        - Antsibull-changelog now uses Pydantic to parse and validate the config.
          This means that validation is more strict than before and might reject configs
          that were incorrect, but still got accepted somehow (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/193).
      release_summary: Feature release.
      removed_features:
        - 'Python API: remove ``antsibull_changelog.rst`` module (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/183).'
        - 'Python API: remove constructor arguments ``plugins`` and ``fragments``
          from class ``ChangelogGenerator`` in ``antsibull_changelog.rendering.changelog``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/183).'
        - 'Python API: remove method ``ChangelogEntry.add_section_content``, class
          ``ChangelogGenerator``, and function ``generate_changelog`` from ``antsibull_changelog.changelog_generator``
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/183).'
        - When using antsibull-changelog as a library, the fields ``changelog_filename_template``,
          ``changelog_filename_version_depth``, and ``output_formats`` are no longer
          available in ``ChangelogConfig``. Use ``output`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/194).

  0.33.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The ``--strict`` option of the ``lint-changelog-yaml`` subcommand no longer
          expects a parameter. It now matches what was documented (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/195,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/196).
      deprecated_features:
        - The boolean valued options ``--is-collection`` and ``--collection-flatmap``
          will likely change to proper flags (``--flag`` and `--no-flag`` instead
          of ``--flag true``/``--flag false``) in the near future. If you are using
          these options and want them to not change, or have other suggestions, please
          `create an issue in the antsibull-changelog repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/new>`__
