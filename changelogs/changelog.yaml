    changes:
      release_summary: Initial release as antsibull-changelog. The Ansible Changelog
        Tool has originally been developed by @mattclay in `the ansible/ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/packaging/release/changelogs/changelog.py>`_
        repository for Ansible itself. It has been extended in `felixfontein/ansible-changelog
        <https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-changelog/>`_ and `ansible-community/antsibull
        <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/>`_ to work with collections,
        until it was moved to its current location `ansible-community/antsibull-changelog
        <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/>`_.
    release_date: '2020-05-30'
  0.10.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Make sure that the plugin caching inside ansible-base/-core works without
        ``--use-ansible-doc``.
      minor_changes:
      - The new ``--cummulative-release`` option for ``antsibull-changelog release``
        allows to add all plugins and objects to a release since whose ``version_added``
        is later than the previous release version (or ancestor if there was no previous
        release), and at latest the current release version. This is needed for major
        releases of ``community.general`` and similarly organized collections.
      - 'Will now print a warning when a release is made where the no ``prelude_section_name``
        section (default: ``release_summary``) appears.'
    release_date: '2021-04-26'
  0.11.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - When subdirectories of ``modules`` are used in ansible-base/ansible-core,
        the wrong module name was passed to ``ansible-doc`` when ``--use-ansible-doc``
        was not used.
      minor_changes:
      - When using ansible-core 2.11 or newer, will now detect new roles with argument
        spec. We only consider the ``main`` entrypoint of roles.
    release_date: '2021-06-13'
  0.12.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix prerelease collapsing when ``use_semantic_versioning`` is set to ``true``
        for ansible-core.
      minor_changes:
      - Support changelogs for other projects than ansible-core/-base and Ansible
        collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/60).
      release_summary: New feature release which supports other projects than ansible-core
        and Ansible collections.

    release_date: '2021-07-11'
  0.13.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix issues with module namespaces when symlinks appear in the path to the
        temp directory (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/68,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/69).
      - Stop mentioning ``galaxy.yaml`` instead of ``galaxy.yml`` in some error messages
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/66).
      minor_changes:
      - Always lint fragments before releasing (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/65,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/67).

  0.14.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - The internal ``changelog.yaml`` linting API allows to use ``packaging.version.Version``
        for version numbers instead of semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/73).
      - Use the new ``--metadata-dump`` option for ansible-core 2.13+ to quickly dump
        and extract all module/plugin ``version_added`` values for the collection
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/72).
      release_summary: Feature release that will speed up the release process with
        ansible-core 2.13.

  0.15.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` file format linting subcommand that was
        previously part of antsibull-lint (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/76,
        https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/issues/410).
      release_summary: Feature release.

    - 76-lint-changelog-yaml.yml
    release_date: '2022-03-30'
  0.16.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Mark rstcheck 4.x and 5.x as compatible. Support rstcheck 6.x as well (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/81).
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to extract other project versions for Python poetry projects from ``pyproject.toml``
        (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/80).
      - The files in the source repository now follow the `REUSE Specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`_.
        The only exceptions are changelog fragments in ``changelogs/fragments/`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/82).
      release_summary: Feature and bugfix release.
    fragments:
    - 0.16.0.yml

      breaking_changes:
      - Drop support for Python 3.6, 3.7, and 3.8 (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/93).

    release_date: '2022-12-17'
  0.2.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Added more testing.
      - Fix internal API for ACD changelog generation (pruning and concatenation of
        changelogs).
      - Improve error handling.
      - Improve reStructuredText creation when new modules with and without namespace
        exist at the same time.
      - Title generation improved (remove superfluous space).
      - Use PyYAML C loader/dumper if available.
      - '``lint`` subcommand no longer requires specification whether it is run inside
        a collection or not (if usual indicators are absent).'
    release_date: '2020-05-31'
  0.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Allow to enumerate plugins/modules with ansible-doc by specifying ``--use-ansible-doc``.
    release_date: '2020-06-10'
  0.3.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to pass path to ansible-doc binary via ``--ansible-doc-bin``.
      - Changelog generator can be ran via ``python -m antsibull_changelog``.
      - Use ``ansible-doc`` instead of ``/path/to/checkout/bin/ansible-doc`` when
        being run in ansible-base checkouts.
    release_date: '2020-06-10'
  0.3.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Do not fail when ``changelogs/fragments`` does not exist. Simply assume there
        are no fragments in that case.
      - Improve behavior when ``changelogs/config.yaml`` is not a dictionary, or does
        not contain ``sections``.
      - Improve error message when ``--is-collection`` is specified and ``changelogs/config.yaml``
        cannot be found, or when the ``lint`` subcommand is used.
    release_date: '2020-06-11'
  0.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fix bad module namespace detection when collection was symlinked into Ansible's
        collection search path. This also allows to add releases to collections which
        are not installed in a way that Ansible finds them.
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to enable or disable flatmapping via ``config.yaml``.
    release_date: '2020-06-22'
  0.5.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - The internal changelog generator code got more flexible to help antsibull
        generate Ansible porting guides.
    release_date: '2020-06-28'
  0.6.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - New changelog configurations place the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` file by default in
        the top-level directory, and not in ``changelogs/``.
      - The config option ``archive_path_template`` allows to move fragments into
        an archive directory when ``keep_fragments`` is set to ``false``.
      - The option ``use_fqcn`` (set to ``true`` in new configurations) allows to
        use FQCN for new plugins and modules.
    release_date: '2020-07-12'
  0.7.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - A new config option, ``ignore_other_fragment_extensions`` allows for configuring
        whether only ``.yaml`` and ``.yml`` files are used (as mandated by the ``ansible-test
        sanity --test changelog`` test). The default value for existing configurations
        is ``false``, and for new configurations ``true``.
      - Allow to use semantic versioning also for Ansible-base with the ``use_semantic_versioning``
        configuration setting.
      - Refactoring changelog generation code to provide all preludes (release summaries)
        in changelog entries, and provide generic functionality to extract a grouped
        list of versions. These changes are mainly for the antsibull project.
    release_date: '2020-07-26'
  0.8.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
      - Allow to not save a changelog on release when using API.
      - Allow to sanitize changelog data on load/save. This means that unknown information
        will be removed, and bad information will be stripped. This will be enabled
        in newly created changelog configs, but is disabled for backwards compatibility.
    release_date: '2020-08-18'
  0.8.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - Fixed error on generating changelogs when using the trivial section.
    release_date: '2020-08-27'
  0.9.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - The new option ``prevent_known_fragments`` with default value being the value
        of ``keep_fragments`` allows to control whether fragments with names that
        already appeared in the past are ignored or not. The new behavior happens
        if ``keep_fragments=false``, and is less surprising to users (see https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/46).
        Changelogs with ``keep_fragments=true``, like the ansible-base/ansible-core
        changelog, are not affected.
      major_changes:
      - Add support for reporting new playbooks and roles in collections.
      - "Add support for special changelog fragment sections which add new plugins
        and/or objects to the changelog for this version. This is mainly useful for
        ``test`` and ``filter`` plugins, and for ``playbook`` and ``role`` objects,
        which are not yet automatically detected and mentioned in ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``
        or the generated RST changelog.\n\nThe format of these sections and their
        content is as follows::\n\n    ---\n    add plugin.filter:\n      - name:
        to_time_unit\n        description: Converts a time expression to a given unit\n
        \     - name: to_seconds\n        description: Converts a time expression
        to seconds\n    add object.role:\n      - name: nginx\n        description:
        The most awesome nginx installation role ever\n    add object.playbook:\n
        \     - name: wipe_server\n        description: Totally wipes a server\n\nFor
        every entry, a list of plugins (section ``add plugin.xxx``) or objects (section
        ``add object.xxx``) of the given type (``filter``, ``test`` for plugins, ``playbook``,
        ``role`` for objects) will be added. Every plugin or object has a short name
        as well as a short description. These fields correspond to the module/plugin
        name and the ``short_description`` field of the ``DOCUMENTATION`` block of
        modules and documentable plugins.\n"
      minor_changes:
      - Add ``--update-existing`` option for ``antsibull-changelog release``, which
        allows to update the current release's release date and (if relevant) codename
        instead of simply reporting that the release already exists.
    release_date: '2021-01-30'
