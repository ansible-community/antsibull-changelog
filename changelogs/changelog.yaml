  0.1.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Initial release as antsibull-changelog. The Ansible Changelog
        Tool has originally been developed by @mattclay in `the ansible/ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/packaging/release/changelogs/changelog.py>`_
        repository for Ansible itself. It has been extended in `felixfontein/ansible-changelog
        <https://github.com/felixfontein/ansible-changelog/>`_ and `ansible-community/antsibull
        <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull/>`_ to work with collections,
        until it was moved to its current location `ansible-community/antsibull-changelog
        <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/>`_.
    release_date: '2020-05-30'
  0.2.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Added more testing.
        - Fix internal API for ACD changelog generation (pruning and concatenation
          of changelogs).
        - Improve error handling.
        - Improve reStructuredText creation when new modules with and without namespace
          exist at the same time.
        - Title generation improved (remove superfluous space).
        - Use PyYAML C loader/dumper if available.
        - '``lint`` subcommand no longer requires specification whether it is run
          inside a collection or not (if usual indicators are absent).'
    release_date: '2020-05-31'
  0.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Allow to enumerate plugins/modules with ansible-doc by specifying ``--use-ansible-doc``.
    release_date: '2020-06-10'
  0.3.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to pass path to ansible-doc binary via ``--ansible-doc-bin``.
        - Changelog generator can be ran via ``python -m antsibull_changelog``.
        - Use ``ansible-doc`` instead of ``/path/to/checkout/bin/ansible-doc`` when
          being run in ansible-base checkouts.
    release_date: '2020-06-10'
  0.3.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Do not fail when ``changelogs/fragments`` does not exist. Simply assume
          there are no fragments in that case.
        - Improve behavior when ``changelogs/config.yaml`` is not a dictionary, or
          does not contain ``sections``.
        - Improve error message when ``--is-collection`` is specified and ``changelogs/config.yaml``
          cannot be found, or when the ``lint`` subcommand is used.
    release_date: '2020-06-11'
  0.4.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix bad module namespace detection when collection was symlinked into Ansible's
          collection search path. This also allows to add releases to collections
          which are not installed in a way that Ansible finds them.
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to enable or disable flatmapping via ``config.yaml``.
    release_date: '2020-06-22'
  0.5.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - The internal changelog generator code got more flexible to help antsibull
          generate Ansible porting guides.
    release_date: '2020-06-28'
  0.6.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - New changelog configurations place the ``CHANGELOG.rst`` file by default
          in the top-level directory, and not in ``changelogs/``.
        - The config option ``archive_path_template`` allows to move fragments into
          an archive directory when ``keep_fragments`` is set to ``false``.
        - The option ``use_fqcn`` (set to ``true`` in new configurations) allows to
          use FQCN for new plugins and modules.
    release_date: '2020-07-12'
  0.7.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - A new config option, ``ignore_other_fragment_extensions`` allows for configuring
          whether only ``.yaml`` and ``.yml`` files are used (as mandated by the ``ansible-test
          sanity --test changelog`` test). The default value for existing configurations
          is ``false``, and for new configurations ``true``.
        - Allow to use semantic versioning also for Ansible-base with the ``use_semantic_versioning``
          configuration setting.
        - Refactoring changelog generation code to provide all preludes (release summaries)
          in changelog entries, and provide generic functionality to extract a grouped
          list of versions. These changes are mainly for the antsibull project.
    release_date: '2020-07-26'
  0.8.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - Allow to not save a changelog on release when using API.
        - Allow to sanitize changelog data on load/save. This means that unknown information
          will be removed, and bad information will be stripped. This will be enabled
          in newly created changelog configs, but is disabled for backwards compatibility.
    release_date: '2020-08-18'
  0.8.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fixed error on generating changelogs when using the trivial section.
    release_date: '2020-08-27'
  0.9.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - The new option ``prevent_known_fragments`` with default value being the
          value of ``keep_fragments`` allows to control whether fragments with names
          that already appeared in the past are ignored or not. The new behavior happens
          if ``keep_fragments=false``, and is less surprising to users (see https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/46).
          Changelogs with ``keep_fragments=true``, like the ansible-base/ansible-core
          changelog, are not affected.
      major_changes:
        - Add support for reporting new playbooks and roles in collections.
        - "Add support for special changelog fragment sections which add new plugins\
          \ and/or objects to the changelog for this version. This is mainly useful\
          \ for ``test`` and ``filter`` plugins, and for ``playbook`` and ``role``\
          \ objects, which are not yet automatically detected and mentioned in ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``\
          \ or the generated RST changelog.\n\nThe format of these sections and their\
          \ content is as follows::\n\n    ---\n    add plugin.filter:\n      - name:\
          \ to_time_unit\n        description: Converts a time expression to a given\
          \ unit\n      - name: to_seconds\n        description: Converts a time expression\
          \ to seconds\n    add object.role:\n      - name: nginx\n        description:\
          \ The most awesome nginx installation role ever\n    add object.playbook:\n\
          \      - name: wipe_server\n        description: Totally wipes a server\n\
          \nFor every entry, a list of plugins (section ``add plugin.xxx``) or objects\
          \ (section ``add object.xxx``) of the given type (``filter``, ``test`` for\
          \ plugins, ``playbook``, ``role`` for objects) will be added. Every plugin\
          \ or object has a short name as well as a short description. These fields\
          \ correspond to the module/plugin name and the ``short_description`` field\
          \ of the ``DOCUMENTATION`` block of modules and documentable plugins.\n"
      minor_changes:
        - Add ``--update-existing`` option for ``antsibull-changelog release``, which
          allows to update the current release's release date and (if relevant) codename
          instead of simply reporting that the release already exists.
    release_date: '2021-01-30'
  0.10.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Make sure that the plugin caching inside ansible-base/-core works without
          ``--use-ansible-doc``.
      minor_changes:
        - The new ``--cummulative-release`` option for ``antsibull-changelog release``
          allows to add all plugins and objects to a release since whose ``version_added``
          is later than the previous release version (or ancestor if there was no
          previous release), and at latest the current release version. This is needed
          for major releases of ``community.general`` and similarly organized collections.
        - 'Will now print a warning when a release is made where the no ``prelude_section_name``
          section (default: ``release_summary``) appears.'
    release_date: '2021-04-26'
  0.11.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - When subdirectories of ``modules`` are used in ansible-base/ansible-core,
          the wrong module name was passed to ``ansible-doc`` when ``--use-ansible-doc``
          was not used.
      minor_changes:
        - When using ansible-core 2.11 or newer, will now detect new roles with argument
          spec. We only consider the ``main`` entrypoint of roles.
    release_date: '2021-06-13'
  0.12.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Fix prerelease collapsing when ``use_semantic_versioning`` is set to ``true``
          for ansible-core.
      minor_changes:
        - Support changelogs for other projects than ansible-core/-base and Ansible
          collections (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/60).

          temp directory (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/68,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/69).
        - Stop mentioning ``galaxy.yaml`` instead of ``galaxy.yml`` in some error
          messages (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/66).
      minor_changes:
        - Always lint fragments before releasing (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/65,
          https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/67).

    release_date: '2021-12-13'
  0.14.0:
    changes:
      minor_changes:
        - The internal ``changelog.yaml`` linting API allows to use ``packaging.version.Version``
          for version numbers instead of semantic versioning (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/73).
        - Use the new ``--metadata-dump`` option for ansible-core 2.13+ to quickly
          dump and extract all module/plugin ``version_added`` values for the collection
          (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/72).

    changes:
      bugfixes:

      major_changes:

          install antsibull`` works exactly the same as before, but some users may
          be affected depending on how they build/install the project (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/109).

      bugfixes:
        - When multiple output formats are defined and ``antsibull-changelog generate``

  0.29.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Remove Python version check that was checking for Python >= 3.6 (instead
          of >= 3.9). This check is not really necessary since ``pyproject.toml``
          declares ``requires-python``, and old enough Python versions where pip does
          not know about ``requires-python`` will not load antsibull-changelog due
          to syntax errors anyway (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/167).
      minor_changes:
        - Add a ``reformat`` command that reformats ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``
          to the current settings of ``changelogs/config.yaml`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/169).
        - 'Adds a new configuration option ``changelog_sort``. This option allows
          sorting of changelog entries in ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/165).

          '
        - Replaces numbers with constants for return codes (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/77).
      release_summary: Feature release.
      removed_features:
        - Removes support for the deprecated classic changelog format. ``changes_format``
          must now be present and set to ``combined`` for ansible-core usage, and
          the value ``classic`` is no longer allowed (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/137).
