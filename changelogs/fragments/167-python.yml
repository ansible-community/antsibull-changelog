bugfixes:
  - "Remove Python version check that was checking for Python >= 3.6 (instead of >= 3.9).
     This check is not really necessary since ``pyproject.toml`` declares ``requires-python``,
     and old enough Python versions where pip does not know about ``requires-python``
     will not load antsibull-changelog due to syntax errors anyway
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/167)."
