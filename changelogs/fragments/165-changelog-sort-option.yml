    Adds a new configuration option `changelog_sort`.
    This option allows sorting of changelog entries in `changelogs/changelog.yaml` with four modes:
    - `unsorted`: No sorting is performed.
    - `version`: Sorts entries by version in ascending order.
    - `version_reverse`: Sorts entries by version in descending order.
    - `alphanumerical`: Sorts entries in alphanumerical order.
