deprecated_features:
  - "The boolean valued options ``--is-collection`` and ``--collection-flatmap`` will likely change to proper flags
     (``--flag`` and `--no-flag`` instead of ``--flag true``/``--flag false``) in the near future.
     If you are using these options and want them to not change, or have other suggestions, please `create an issue
     in the antsibull-changelog repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/issues/new>`__
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/pull/199)."
