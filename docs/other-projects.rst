The ``antsibull-changelog`` tool allows you to create and update changelogs for arbitrary projects, similar to the changelog of ansible-core or many Ansible collections which rely on antsibull-changelog.

The following instructions assume that antsibull has been properly installed, for example via ``pip install antsibull-changelog``. This is the preferred way to install ``antsibull-changelog``.

If you want to get the current ``main`` branch with not yet released changes, run ``pip install https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/archive/main.tar.gz``. If you cloned the git repository and want to run it from there with ``poetry``, ``antsibull-changelog`` has to be substituted with ``poetry run antsibull-changelog``.

Bootstrapping changelogs for projects
=====================================

To set up ``antsibull-changelog``, run::

    antsibull-changelog init --is-other-project /path/to/your/project

This creates subdirectories ``changelogs/`` and ``changelogs/fragments/``, and a configuration file ``changelogs/config.yaml``. Adjust the configuration file to your needs. The settings of highest interest are:

#. ``title``: This is by default ``Project``. Please replace this with the name of your project.
#. ``use_semantic_versioning``: The default value ``true`` assumes that version numbers follow the `semantic versioning spec <https://semver.org/>`_. This mostly affects prerelease detection and version ordering.
#. ``keep_fragments``: The default value ``false`` removes the fragment files after a release is done. If you prefer to keep fragment files for older releases, set this to ``true``. If you want to remove fragments after a release, but archive them in another directory, you can use the ``archive_path_template`` option in combination with ``keep_fragments: no`. See further below in the list for its usage.
#. ``changelog_filename_template``: The default value ``../CHANGELOG.rst`` is relative to the ``changelogs/`` directory.
#. ``always_refresh``: See :ref:`refreshing` on refreshing changelog fragments
#. ``archive_path_template``: If ``keep_fragments`` is set to ``false``, and ``archive_path_template`` is set, fragments will be copied into the directory denoted by ``archive_path_template`` instead of being deleted. The directory is created if it does not exist. The placeholder ``{version}`` can be used for the current project version into which the fragment was included.

For a description of all configuration settings, see the separate document `Configuration Settings for antsibull-changelog <./changelog-configuration.rst>`_.

Validating changelog fragments
==============================

If you want to do a basic syntax check of changelog fragments, you can run::

    antsibull-changelog lint

If you want to check a specific fragment, you can provide a path to it; otherwise, all fragments in ``changelogs/fragments/`` are checked. This can be used in CI to avoid contributors to check in invalid changelog fragments, or introduce new sections (by mistyping existing ones, or simply guessing wrong names).

If ``antsibull-changelog lint`` produces no output on stdout, and exits with exit code 0, the changelog fragments are OK. If errors are found, they are reported by one line in stdout for each error in the format ``path/to/fragment:line:column:message``, and the program exits with exit code 3. Other exit codes indicate problems with the command line or during the execution of the linter.

Releasing a new version of your project
=======================================

To release a new version of your project, you need to run::

    antsibull-changelog release --version <version>

inside your project's tree. You can also specify a release date with ``--date 2020-12-31``, if the default (today) is not what you want.

When doing a release, the changelog generator will read all changelog fragments which are not already mentioned in the changelog, and include them in a new entry in ``changelogs/changelog.yaml``.

After running ``antsibull-changelog release``, you should check ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` and the generated reStructuredText file (by default ``CHANGELOG.rst``) in.

.. _refreshing:

Updating/Refreshing changelog.yaml
==================================

By default, the ``changelogs/changelog.yaml`` file is the main source of truth for antsibull-changelog. It is only modified when a new release is done, and in that case existing entries for other versions than the current one are not touched.

If the main source of truth should be the fragments, the refreshing options or config has to be used.

#. The ``always_refresh`` configuration is a string with one of the following values:
    * ``none`` (default): equivalent to ``--refresh-fragments`` and ``--refresh`` not specified;
    * ``full``: equivalent to ``--refresh-fragments with-archives`` specified, or alternatively ``--refresh``;
    * a comma-separated list, where the following entries are supported:
        * ``fragments``: equivalent to ``--refresh-fragments with-archives`` specified;
        * ``fragments-without-archives``: equivalent to ``--refresh-fragments without-archives`` specified.

#. The ``--refresh`` command line parameter is equivalent to ``--refresh-fragments with-archives``.

#. ``--refresh-fragments``: if specified, the fragments for all versions will be recreated from the changelog fragment files. This is only possible if ``keep_fragments`` is ``true``, or fragment archives exist (see the ``archive_path_template`` option). Note that if not all fragments were archived or kept in the fragments directory, they will be **removed** from the changelog.
    * ``with-archives`` (default): Uses both the archives and the current fragment directory to update the fragments.
    * ``without-archives``: Uses only the current fragment directory to update the fragments. Fragments that have been moved to the archive and no longer exist in the fragment directory will vanish from the changelog.

Changelog Fragment Categories
=============================

This section describes the section categories created in the default config. If you really want, you can change them.

The categories are the same as the ones in the `Ansible-case changelog fragments <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/development_process.html#changelogs-how-to>`_.

The full list of categories is:

**release_summary**
  This is a special section: as opposed to a list of strings, it accepts one string. This string will be inserted at the top of the changelog entry for the current version, before any section. There can only be one fragment with a ``release_summary`` section. In ansible-core, this is used for stating the release date and for linking to the porting guide (`example <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/changelogs/fragments/v2.9.0_summary.yaml>`_, `result <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.9.rst#id23>`_).

**breaking_changes**
  This (new) category should list all changes to features which absolutely require attention from users when upgrading, because an existing behavior is changed. This is mostly what Ansible's Porting Guide used to describe. This section should only appear in a initial major release (`x.0.0`) according to semantic versioning.

**major_changes**
  This category contains major changes to the project. It should only contain a few items per major version, describing high-level changes. This section should not appear in patch releases according to semantic versioning.

**minor_changes**
  This category should mention all new features, like plugin or module options. This section should not appear in patch releases according to semantic versioning.

**removed_features**
  This category should mention all modules, plugins and features that have been removed in this release. This section should only appear in a initial major release (`x.0.0`) according to semantic versioning.

**deprecated_features**
  This category should contain all modules, plugins and features which have been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. This section should not appear in patch releases according to semantic versioning.

**security_fixes**
  This category should mention all security relevant fixes, including CVEs if available.

**bugfixes**
  This category should be a list of all bug fixes which fix a bug that was present in a previous version.

**known_issues**
  This category should mention known issues that are currently not fixed or will not be fixed.

**trivial**
  This category will **not be shown** in the changelog. It can be used to describe changes that are not touching user-facing code, like changes in tests. This is useful if every PR is required to have a changelog fragment.

There are some special categories starting with "`add `"; please see the next section for details.

Examples
--------

A guide on how to write changelog fragments can be found in the `Ansible docs <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/development_process.html#changelogs-how-to>`_.

Example of a regular changelog fragment::

    bugfixes:
      - docker_container - wait for removal of container if docker API returns early
        (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65811).

The filename in this case was ``changelogs/fragments/65854-docker_container-wait-for-removal.yml``, because this was implemented in `PR #65854 in ansible/ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65854>`_.

A fragment can also contain multiple sections, or multiple entries in one section::

    deprecated_features:
    - docker_container - the ``trust_image_content`` option will be removed. It has always been ignored by the module.
    - docker_stack - the return values ``err`` and ``out`` have been deprecated. Use ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` from now on instead.

    breaking_changes:
    - "docker_container - no longer passes information on non-anonymous volumes or binds as ``Volumes`` to the Docker daemon. This increases compatibility with the ``docker`` CLI program. Note that if you specify ``volumes: strict`` in ``comparisons``, this could cause existing containers created with docker_container from Ansible 2.9 or earlier to restart."

The ``release_summary`` section is special, in that it doesn't contain a list of strings, but a string, and that only one such entry can be shown in the changelog of a release. Usually for every release (pre-release or regular release), at most one fragment is added which contains a ``release_summary``, and this is only done by the person doing the release. The ``release_summary`` should include some global information on the release; for example, in `Ansible's changelog <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/stable-2.9/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.9.rst#release-summary>`_, it always mentions the release date and links to the porting guide.

An example of how a fragment with ``release_summary`` could look like::

    release_summary: |
      This is the first proper release of ``antsibull-changelog`` on 2020-06-20.
