A changelog generator used by ansible-core and Ansible collections.

- Using the
  [`antsibull-changelog` CLI tool for collections](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/tree/main/docs/changelogs.rst).
- Using the
  [`antsibull-changelog` CLI tool for other projects](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/tree/main/docs/other-projects.rst).
- Documentation on the [`changelogs/config.yaml` configuration file for `antsibull-changelog`](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/tree/main/docs/changelog-configuration.rst).
- Documentation on the
  [`changelog.yaml` format](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/tree/main/docs/changelog.yaml-format.md).

antsibull-changelog is covered by the [Ansible Code of Conduct](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html).

## Installation

It can be installed with pip:

    pip install antsibull-changelog

For more information, see the
[documentation](https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-changelog/tree/main/docs/changelogs.rst).

## Using directly from git clone

Scripts are created by poetry at build time.  So if you want to run from
a checkout, you'll have to run them under poetry:

    python3 -m pip install poetry
    poetry install  # Installs dependencies into a virtualenv
    poetry run antsibull-changelog --help

If you want to create a new release:

    poetry build
    poetry publish  # Uploads to pypi.  Be sure you really want to do this

Note: When installing a package published by poetry, it is best to use pip >= 19.0.
Installing with pip-18.1 and below could create scripts which use pkg_resources
which can slow down startup time (in some environments by quite a large amount).

If you prefer to work with `pip install -e`, you can use [dephell](https://pypi.org/project/dephell/)
to create a `setup.py` file from `pyproject.toml`:

    dephell deps convert --from-path pyproject.toml --from-format poetry --to-path setup.py --to-format setuppy

Then you can install antsibull-changelog with `pip install -e .`.

## Build a release

First update the `version` entry in `pyproject.toml`. Then generate the changelog:

    antsibull-changelog release

Then build the build artefact:

    poetry build

Finally, publish to PyPi:

    poetry publish

Then tag the current state with the release version and push the tag to the repository.
